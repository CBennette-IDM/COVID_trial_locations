# We'll load 3 data sources 
# 1) clinical trial data from Cytel's clinical trial tracker, which is a nicely cleaned up list of all COVID19 trials derived from clinicaltrial.gov (and other sources for international trials)
# 2) zip codes of trials from AACT, which is the gold standard for cleaned up data from clinicaltrials.gov; doesn't have some of the more nuanced fields that Cytel's tracker does, but it includes zip codes of all trial location
# 3) Census-based data on zip-code tabulation level demographics
# 4) Other zip code level case counts (or only county?)
